# York University Rover Team - ROS Repository
The ROS repository for YURT 2018-19.

Maintained primarily by Adam Silverman (@ajs0429) and Mastafa Awal (@awalm).

We strongly recommend that you [install ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial before cloning this repository. Then, go over the [ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) so that you can understand the code better.

Only the maintainers and admins can commit to **master**. For everyone else, start a branch and submit a pull request when you're done. We will review your code before it shows up in **master**.

If you have any questions or issues with Git or the repo, feel free to Slack us!
